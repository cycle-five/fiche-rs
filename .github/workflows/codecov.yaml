# The section is needed to drop write-all permissions that are granted on
# `schedule` event. By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set
# to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised
# workflow can do (because of an injection or compromised third party tool or
# action) is restricted. Currently the worklow doesn't need any additional
# permission except for pulling the code. Adding labels to issues, commenting
# on pull-requests, etc. may need additional permissions:
